# PopClick Lua Module

This is a lua module for using my [PopClick](https://github.com/trishume/PopClick) VAMP plugins.
The intention is for this to allow you to connect mouth noises to computer actions with [HammerSpoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/).
It's currently just a work in progress shell, it doesn't do anything yet.
